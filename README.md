![Titanic_plans](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b742ee8a-9487-4ac1-8c76-89d003b71e4c)

## Overview
This project explores the “Titanic” dataset, originally published by Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, which sank in 1912. It is widely used for testing machine learning algorithms and visualizations (such as bar charts and heatmaps). Each row represents a passenger and includes details such as their age, gender, class, fare paid, and whether they survived the disaster.

## Dataset Features
The dataset features include:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply various machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees. Additionally, the project aims to assess feature importance to understand the contributing factors to survival.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, among others.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyblx/titanic_disaster.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the dataset and view the analysis results.
